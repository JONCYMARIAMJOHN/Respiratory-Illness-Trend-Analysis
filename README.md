# Respiratory-Illness-Trend-Analysis
A ML project which understanding respiratory illnesses like influenza, COVID-19, and RSV which are crucial for public health. This project will analyze a dataset from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), which includes weekly data on emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory conditions.

We will explore how different factors, such as age and race/ethnicity, affect the number of visits related to these illnesses. By using machine learning techniques, we aim to identify trends and make predictions about future cases.

Our analysis will include various methods to find patterns in the data, helping healthcare providers and public health officials better respond to respiratory illness outbreaks. This project seeks to provide valuable insights that can improve health outcomes and resource management during peak illness seasons.
